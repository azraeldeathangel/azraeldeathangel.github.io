title: 0x1 - The Epidemic Behind Facebook Hacking
---

## Introduction

I should have written about this earlier, but after hearing about countless Facebook accounts being hacked, I decided to create this article to spread awareness and hopefully save a few people from falling victim.

Lately, I've noticed a disturbing trend of Facebook accounts being compromised—not through sophisticated exploits or zero-day vulnerabilities but through simple **social engineering** tactics.

So how does this happen? Let’s break it down.

## The Exploit: Human Hacking

Surprisingly, the main culprit behind Facebook account hacks is not a high-tech vulnerability but **humans themselves**. Social engineering, often referred to as **human hacking**, exploits trust and manipulation to gain unauthorized access.

Here’s a common scenario: The attacker uses Facebook's "Ask for login code" feature to request access to your account. Then they contact you, pretending to be someone trustworthy, and convince you to share the code.

### Common Phrases Used by Attackers:
- "Send me the login code."
- "Forward the code to me so I can claim your reward."

Once you share the code? Game over.

## Sample Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The "Free Voucher" Trap

**English Translation:**
> Sis, I'll invite you to Lazada so you can get a free voucher. Check your Facebook notifications, and once the code comes through, send it to me so I can redeem it.

Does this even make sense? Why would Facebook codes be connected to Lazada vouchers?

## Protecting Yourself

If someone asks for a **login code**, **don’t share it**. Block and ignore them. Here’s a quick checklist:

1. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** This adds an extra layer of protection to your account.
2. **Avoid Clicking Unknown Links:** Even if the link comes from someone you trust, verify before clicking.
3. **Be Skeptical:** Attackers often impersonate people you know. Always double-check if a request seems suspicious.
4. **Regularly Review Account Activity:** Check for unauthorized logins in Facebook’s settings.

Remember: **No legitimate service will ask for your login code.**

## Final Thoughts

Social engineering attacks thrive on trust and carelessness. Stay alert, educate others, and remember—if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
