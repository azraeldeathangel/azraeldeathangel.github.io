title: 0x1 - The Epidemic behind Facebook Hacking
---
### Introduction

I should've done this before, and I'm really pissed off right now, so I decided to create an article about Facebook users' epidemic of getting hacked to save people.

Lately, I've been encountering and hearing about a lot of accounts on Facebook—a social networking website owned by Meta—getting hacked.

The thing is, there aren't any sophisticated attacks, zero-day exploits, or web application vulnerabilities being used to compromise people's Facebook accounts.

### The Exploit

I know this might sound ridiculous, but the exploit behind Facebook hacking is humans themselves. Social engineering, also known as **Human Hacking**.

Most of the time, what the hacker does is try to persuade their victim into giving up their login codes after abusing the "Ask for login code" feature on Facebook to take over the account.

And once you give them the login code they're asking for? You're fucked. Always watch out for these common phrases that the attackers use

### Common Phrases Used by Attackers:
- "Send me the login code."
- "Forward the code to me so I can claim your reward."

### Sample Scenario

**English translation:**

- Sis, I'll invite you to Lazada so you can get a free voucher. Check your Facebook notifications, and once the code comes through, send it to me so I can redeem it.

### Sample Scenario 2

**English translation:**

- Send your phone number for a free 500 pesos load from Bongbong Marcos and Facebook Meta Corporation.

What does the Philippines President and Facebook Meta even have to do with giving out free 500 pesos load?

### How to Protect Ourselves

If someone is trying to ask you for any LOGIN code, just **don't fucking do it**. Block them and ignore them, alright? And don't even click any links they send.

It's that simple. **IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU KNOW THE PERSON OR YOU DON'T**—attackers mostly compromise accounts of your mutuals. It could be a relative, family member, or anyone. They take advantage of the compromised account to impersonate them and exploit your trust to trick you into sending your login code.

So how the can we stay safe? Just don't click anything and don't send any code. There's no such thing as free money.

1. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** This adds an extra layer of protection to your account.
2. **Avoid Clicking Unknown Links:** Even if the link comes from someone you trust, verify before clicking.
3. **Be Skeptical:** Attackers often impersonate people you know. Always double-check if a request seems suspicious.
4. **Regularly Review Account Activity:** Check for unauthorized logins in Facebook’s settings.

Remember: **No legitimate service will ask for your login code.**

And no, I don't recover accounts. Once the hacker removes your email and phone number, you can't retrieve it anymore. Meta is stupid enough not to implement proper support chats—they only provide support to those subscribed to their Verified subscription.
