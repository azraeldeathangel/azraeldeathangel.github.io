## Introduction
We’ve all seen the stereotypical 'hacker' — wearing a black hoodie, staring at a screen filled with green binary code. But in reality, hackers aren’t like that. So, how do you actually become one? With so much information about cybersecurity out there, it can feel overwhelming. But don't worry; I’ll break it down simply, without any fluff.

### First off: To become a good hacker, you need three things: **discipline**, **consistency**, and **determination to learn**. 
Technology is constantly evolving, which means you’ll always need to keep learning. If you don’t know something, or if you come across an unfamiliar term, don’t be afraid to Google it. Being able to search for answers is a skill in itself. It's far better to Google something than to repeatedly ask questions you could easily find answers to on your own.

### Cybersecurity is more than just hacking
One common misconception is that diving into cybersecurity automatically makes you a hacker. That's not true! There are many roles in the field, such as:

- Security Engineer
- Security Operations
- Threat Intelligence
- Risk Assessment
- Governance
- Penetration Tester (which is what most people are interested in!)

Now, let’s talk about the foundational knowledge you need before diving into cybersecurity.

### [Computer Science Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)
Before moving into advanced topics, you should start with the basics of computer science. You’ll learn how systems work, including CPUs, binary numbers, and more. 

### [Network Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SIjoeE93lo&list=PLDQaRcbiSnqF5U8ffMgZzS7fq1rHUI3Q8)
Networking is essential because everything in cybersecurity is connected. You'll learn about IP addresses, MAC addresses, subnetting, and more. I personally recommend HackTheBox's "Introduction to Networking" module, but the video linked above is also a great resource.

Do you need to study for certifications like Network+ or CCNA? I don't think so. These are more advanced and vendor-specific, and many of the lessons won’t be directly applicable to cybersecurity roles unless you're aiming to be a network engineer. For most network problems, you can always Google the solution.

### Programming 
To break or hack something, you need to understand how it works first. While many recommend starting with Python, I believe learning C first gives you a better understanding of how things work on a lower, more fundamental level.

### [Linux](https://linuxjourney.com/)
Linux is a must-learn. Most hacking tools and engagements are done on Linux, so you need to be comfortable with this operating system.

### Practical Application
Now that you’ve got the fundamentals, it’s time for hands-on learning. I highly recommend PortSwigger, VulnHub, TryHackMe rooms (not their paths), and HackTheBox Academy. I personally learned a lot from HackTheBox Academy, and if you have a student email, it’s only $8 a month. But, start with PortSwigger to familiarize yourself with basic vulnerabilities, and then move on to HackTheBox Academy. VulnHub is also an excellent platform for hands-on practice.

### Final Tip: Don’t be a cert addict
Certifications don’t define your skills. Focus on gaining practical knowledge and only get enough certifications to show competency. Upskill consistently.
